    "Due to the relatively large sample number (e.g. 8kHz), performing [DTW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_time_warping) on the raw audio signal is not advised (feel free to try!).\n",
    "A better solution is to compute a set of features; here we will extract [mel-frequency cepstral coefficients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel-frequency_cepstrum) over windows of 25ms length, shifted by 10ms.\n",
    "Recommended implementation is [librosa](https://librosa.org/doc/main/generated/librosa.feature.mfcc.html).\n",

    "### Data\n",

    "Download Zohar Jackson's [free spoken digit dataset](https://github.com/Jakobovski/free-spoken-digit-dataset).\n",
    "There's no need to clone, feel free to use a revision, like [v1.0.10](https://github.com/Jakobovski/free-spoken-digit-dataset/archive/refs/tags/v1.0.10.tar.gz).\n",
    "File naming convention is trivial (`{digitLabel}_{speakerName}_{index}.wav`); let's restrict to two speakers, eg. `jackson` and `george`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dynamic Time Warping\n",
    "\n",
    "[DTW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_time_warping) is closely related to [Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) and [Needleman-Wunsch algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needleman–Wunsch_algorithm).\n",
    "The main rationale behind DTW is that the two sequences are can be aligned but their speed and exact realization may very.\n",
    "In consequence, cost is not dependent on an edit operation but on a difference in observations.\n",
